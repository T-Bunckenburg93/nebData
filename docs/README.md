# Welcome To my Insights of the game [Nebulous Fleet Command](https://steamcommunity.com/app/887570). 

Here I'm trying to find insights and analysis of the artifacts of Nebulous (neb) and see what value I can pull out of this to showcase my work in Data and Analytics. I'm doing this using the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) as I see it as an exciting language that applies well to data science. 

With these posts, I'm going to try and delve insight from both what I see in the data, as well as my knowledge as an ok Neb player. I'm silver, vaugely understand how Ewar works and can use heading commands badly. 

Here I am using a bunch of battle reports, a few from my own games (~100), most from M1 Abrams from NebKillBoard (~750), and some from Lark (~200). I'm very thankful for these as data is a numbers game, and the more the merrier. 

For consistency, I used non modded multiplayer games only, with ideally OSP vs ANS. While the battle reports don't specifiy, I am assuming that most games were control. Unfortunately the maps are not specified, but with enough numbers, this hopefully shouldn't matter too much.
