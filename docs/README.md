# Welcome To my Insights of the game [Nebulous Fleet Command](https://steamcommunity.com/app/887570). 

Here I'm trying to find insights and analysis of the artifacts of Nebulous and see what value I can pull out of tihs to showcase my work in Data and Analytics. I'm doing this using the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) as I see it as an exciting language that applies well to data science.
