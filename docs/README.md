Welcome To my Insights of the game [Nebulous Fleet Command](https://steamcommunity.com/app/887570). 

Here I'm trying to find insights and analysis of the artifacts of Nebulous (neb) and see what value I can pull out of this to showcase my work in Data and Analytics. I'm doing this using the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) as I see it as an exciting language that applies well to data science. 

With these posts, I'm going to try and delve insight from both what I see in the data, as well as my knowledge as an ok Neb player. I'm silver, vaugely understand how Ewar works and can use heading commands badly. I also have a 68% win rate on NebKillBoard. Not great, not terrible.

While I don't have a specific goal in mind, I'm hoping that what you read in here, might make you a better Neb Player, or at least will be interesting!

## Disclaimers and other FAQ 

Here I am using a bunch of battle reports, a few from my own games (~100), most from M1 Abrams from NebKillBoard (~750), and some from Lark (~200). I'm very thankful for these as data is a numbers game, and the more the merrier. 

For consistency, I used non modded multiplayer games only, with ideally OSP vs ANS. While the battle reports don't specifiy, I am assuming that most games were control. Unfortunately the maps are not specified, but with enough numbers, this hopefully shouldn't matter too much.  

I'm doing this for a bit of fun, and to practice some real world skills. I appreciate constructive feedback and discussion on the topics and hope that it generates some insight to your Nebulous experience. 

Because I do this in my spare time, its not going to be as polished as a my work I get paid for. I also type most of my stuff directly in markdown, so spelling errors are likely. Please be kind. 

If you have battle reports, I'm very keen to get my hands on them! One of the thoughts was that I could set up a file drop thing, but you could also zip them up and send them to me over discord.
