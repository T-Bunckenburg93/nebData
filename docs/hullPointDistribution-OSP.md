# Do points matter - OSP

"The point distributon of a hull effect the likelihood of the hull participating in a wining team"

While I don't think anyone would disagree with this on the face value, as you need to spend points to buy guns/missiles/etc to shoot ships, I did wonder if there were optimal amounts of points to spend on a hull. 

For example, if I seriously kit out two gun Vauxhalls, is this more effective than have three less kitted Vaux's, or two Vaux's and several escorts?  
Is there a point where we can see in the data that spending too much, and putting too many eggs in one basket is more likely to be detrimental? 

Now a bit of a note on this and the conclusions I'm going to make here. This isn't to say that your build is bad because you're spending too much points on a Vauxhall. The great thing about Nebulous is that the meta is still growing and developing, and none of the hulls exhibit a huge win loss difference (except one), meaning that people also can win with hulls that cost that much. It just happens less, which makes it less **viable**. 

While points are a somewhat crude measure, as they don't take into account the difference between missiles and guns and lasers, there did seem to be some insight that you can take away from them.  
Anyway, without further ado, lets get to it!

### Quick word on how to read these charts:

For each Hull, there are two charts. The top is a histogram of the win/loss by point value. I've done this for every hull I have stats on, so there are naturally higher values for smaller ships. 

Then there is the winrate at each 100 point range. Note that this will be skewed by smaller values.

Finally, in the header, there is the total winrate. This is the number of wins / number of games this hull has been in. 

# OSP Hulls

## Shuttles

### Thoughts and musings

Shuttles are a very effective hull, and have a high win rate. Good for many roles. This chart would suggest that points put into sprinters are generlly pretty well spent.


## Tugboat

### Thoughts and musings

Tugs have a pretty similar role to Sprinters, though slower but with slightly more mounts. They shine in the 200-300 pt range. Tug swarms are a tough nut to crack, and the bloodhound + early warning radar tug builds are pretty effective at getting good intel. Tugs fit into a lot of strong OSP builds, so I'm not suprised that they are well represented. 

## Bulk Feeder / Monitor

### Thoughts and musings

These ships work well as swarms, and shine at the 500 pt spit, as well as the 700 pt. I think the 700-1000 point is the S2 Spam, and I also suspect that the 700 point is more effective than the 1000 pt,  is becasue 4 ships that spew out missiles has better pen than 3 or 2. 

Beyond that, the Monitor doesn't seem to have any other strong points, but also doesn't seem to have any builds where it performs badly (based off point cost)

## Conclusions

Getting the right amount of points into a hull is hard. This post should be used as a guide, not as a rule, as there are many other factors beyond hull cost that go into winning a game. Building fleets to fit inside the numbers that I'm seeing here shouldn't be the aim, as things like team coordination, abilitiy and fleet synergy matter far more. Winning games in Nebulous is a complicated business, and sometimes you just get stomped because of the risks you take. 

This post also fails at saying what are the best parts for the build, but unfortunately this isn't really in the battle report. 

However, on this, I think I do have some takeaways:

* You can definately overbuild your fleets. Specially for Hulls like the Raines, the Keystone and the Solomon, more points don't often make the hull much more effective.  

* Support ships are very effective. I think one of the more underatted parts of Neb is intelligence/vision. Maybe that comes under Ewar, but being able to keep eyes on more of the map allows you to make more informed tactical decisions. In this sense, support ships are a force multiplier for your team. For example, your intelligence might show 3 fleets on one side of the map, which allows 2 of your team mates to push D, and steamrolling the single fleet that tried to hold that side. In the battlespace, the intelligence you gained by having an extra Sprinter or shuttle was more effective than having a super accurate solomon. 

* Single ship missile fleets seem underwelming? these fleet generally seem to consistently lose more than they win. I don't know why this might be the case, but it seemed to be a common theme across Vauxhalls and Axfords. 

* The 3000 point Solomon seems like an objectively bad build that will lose aboout 65% of the time. 

## Whats next

I'm going to do OSP next, but It might be a touch longer. I've also got a rudimentry neural network to predict the outcome of a battle based on the hulls on either side. The only thing is, I need about 10x more battle reports that I currently have to feel confident in it. More would be appreciated!
