# Cluster Hulls by Componenets

I've doing a clustering analysis to build on the point distributon analysis I did initally. 
The most common response, and my thoughts while I was building it, was that point cost is not a simple indication of ship build, and thus outcome. So I've spent a bit of time refining it, primarily by adding a bunch of components into the mix. 

Ive tried to build a model that both accomodates common builds, but also includes more niche builds that do show up. 
This has led to some overlap, and prossibly some differential of clusters that doesn't really exist, as well as lots of clusters ( $sz ), but I do feel/hope that this is reasonable representative of the ships rolls that you can see in Nebulous.

## Description of the tables:

### Hull Counts
Hull count shuld be pretty obvious. Generally there is one, but often there is overlap 

### Components
Here I tried to identify the specific componenets that made up a cluster. 
* meanVal, is the average number of that value that you would expect to see on this rype of hull. 
* proportion, is the proportion of this component that is in this cluster. for example, the first group contains about 50% of all S1/rockets
* scaledProportion, is this, but scaled by the size of the cluster, to make this number more meaningful for smaller clusters. if you had a component 50% of the time, and the size of the cluster was 10% of all ships, this number would be 5

Note that for weapons and missiles, the values are the ammo count, not the number of weapons. 

### Exemplar
Each cluster is focused around a single ship that serves at the exemplar. This is the hull/components that this exemplar had.

### Hull Outcome vs WinRate
Counts and Percentages of wins and losses vs the ship being eliminated or not. Ideally this should show if the cluster is effective or not.



Now I'm not going to do a writeup of each one, as there are $sz, but I do hope this is interesting. I will be using these clusters in the future to try and group fleet types, as I feel there is a lot of interesting things to unpack there.

Enjoy, and let me know what you think!
